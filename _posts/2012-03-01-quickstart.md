The following steps will run a small **NSQ** cluster on your local machine and walk through
publishing, consuming, and archiving messages to disk.

 1. follow the instructions in the [INSTALLING][installing] doc.

 2. in one shell, start `nsqlookupd`:
        
        $ nsqlookupd

 3. in another shell, start `nsqd`. If your system hostname does not resolve to 127.0.0.1 then you'll have to add the `--broadcast-address=127.0.0.1` option.:

        $ nsqd --lookupd-tcp-address=127.0.0.1:4160

 4. in another shell, start `nsqadmin`:

        $ nsqadmin --lookupd-http-address=127.0.0.1:4161

 5. publish an initial message (creates the topic in the cluster, too):
 
        $ curl -d 'hello world 1' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=test'

 6. finally, in another shell, start `nsq_to_file`:

        $ nsq_to_file --topic=test --output-dir=/tmp --lookupd-http-address=127.0.0.1:4161

 7. publish more messages to `nsqd`:

        $ curl -d 'hello world 2' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=test'
        $ curl -d 'hello world 3' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/pub?topic=test'

 8. to verify things worked as expected, in a web browser open `http://127.0.0.1:4171/` to view 
    the `nsqadmin` UI and see statistics.  Also, check the contents of the log files (`test.*.log`) 
    written to `/tmp`.

The important lesson here is that `nsq_to_file` (the client) is not explicitly told where the `test`
topic is produced, it retrieves this information from `nsqlookupd` and, despite the timing of the
connection, no messages are lost.
